Hello world :)

I started my career as a developer by learning PHP, where I discovered that I love blending logic and creativity to solve problems. This passion also led me to explore gastronomy as a chef, where logic and creativity are essential for crafting recipes and managing the kitchen in real time.

Currently, I am fully focused on enhancing my skills in web development and user experience. I am committed to learning and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the digital world, always looking for ways to make online interactions more intuitive and satisfying.

I am excited to continue growing in this field and to apply everything I've learned from both programming and cooking to offer innovative and effective solutions.

Currently, I am practicing daily to improve my skills in React and TypeScript; and starting with .NET (C#), which will be my next step.

I'm passionate about projects where aesthetics meet functionality, and I'm eager to bring my unique blend of skills and experiences to the table.
