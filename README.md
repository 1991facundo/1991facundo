Hello world :)

I'm a professional with a twist, blending a rich background in culinary arts with a passion for frontend development. Over the past two years, I've been on an exciting journey, starting with a UX Design course at the National Technological University of Buenos Aires and diving into the tech world thereafter.

My journey has been diverse, encompassing roles in customer service at Airbnb, content moderation at Snapchat, and freelance account management in marketing. Alongside these experiences, I dedicated eight months to a rigorous Front-end Developer course and over 800 hours to a comprehensive Full Stack bootcamp at SoyHenry, solidifying my technical foundation.

Beyond my tech endeavors, I'm currently immersed in the development and maintenance of montagne.com.ar, where I contribute to the enhancement of user experiences and functionality.

My transition from chef to developer isn't just about learning new skills; it's about leveraging the organizational, multitasking, and leadership abilities honed in the kitchen. These skills seamlessly integrate into my approach, allowing me to thrive in fast-paced environments and effectively manage projects.

In addition to my freelance consulting for e-commerce ventures, where I streamline API integrations, I serve as a lead teaching assistant at SoyHenry. Here, I orchestrate coding practice programs, drawing on agile methodologies and educational leadership to empower students.

I'm passionate about projects where aesthetics meet functionality, and I'm eager to bring my unique blend of skills and experiences to the table.
