### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a former chef who has taken a unique path into the world of frontend development. My journey is a blend of creativity, leadership, and an unrelenting pursuit of innovation.

After starting with a UX Design course at the National Technological University of Buenos Aires, I delved into the fascinating world of technology. This transition marked the beginning of an eclectic journey that started in 2022, going through customer service at Airbnb, content moderation at Snapchat, and freelance account management in marketing.

During 2022 and 2023, I deepened my technical skills with a Front-end Developer course first and then a Full Stack course at the SoyHenry bootcamp. It was a revelation: programming is not just algorithms and code; it's an art, where design and logic coexist. This resonated with my passion for creativity and design, confirming that I had found my new vocation.

Now, I am excited to integrate my extensive experience with my newly acquired technical expertise. My goal is to contribute to projects where aesthetics and functionality intertwine, leveraging my diverse experience to bring a unique perspective. I am eager to explore opportunities in this dynamic field, continuously learning and evolving along the way.

At the moment, I am open to work opportunities. Contact me by sending an email to facundo91.1401@gmail.com and let's chat!
